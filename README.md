# ID compression for Vector databases 

This is the implementation of the paper [Lossless Compression of Vector IDs for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search](http://arxiv.org/pdf/fill_link_when_ready) by Daniel Severo, Matthew Muckley, Karen Ullrich, Giuseppe Ottaviano and Matthijs Douze. 

The package is implemented in Python and partly in C++.

## Compiling 

Most of the code is written as a plugin to the [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) vector search library. 
Therefore Faiss should be installed and available from Python.
